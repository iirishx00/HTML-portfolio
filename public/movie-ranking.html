<h1>The Best Movies According to Iris </h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Pursuit of Happyness</h3>
<p>The brightest of light comes when the dark is at its full. 
I might sound here  bit exaggerating, but this movie gave me strength for the rest of my life.</p>

<h3>A magical dot over in the corner</h3>
<p>Miyazaki says he made the film specifically for 10-year-old girls.
That is why it plays so powerfully for adult viewers.</p>

<h3>La La Land</h3>
<p>Musicals made me a romantic. They taught me that some emotion is so 
powerful that it can’t be put into mere words—it must be sung. 
Some love is so overwhelming that you just have to move your feet.</p>
